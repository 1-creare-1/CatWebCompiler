Code compiler for roblox game [Cat Web](https://www.roblox.com/games/16855862021)
The game uses a block-based coding language. Luckly its possible to import code via json so I've made this compiler which coverts a basic text based language into cat web's json format.

Todo
- [ ] Variables
- [ ] Conditionals
- [ ] Loops
- [ ] Functions (Cat web doesn't have functions, this will be a compiler time macro-like thing)
